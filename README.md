## HandBell Startup ##

A failed startup of a single founder and engineer and everything else role! But still useful for some cases.

The goal of the app is to order in restaurants from client to waiter without having to really talk. By scanning a QR on the table, the bar or restaurant would acknowledge the order.

It makes use of Sockets to make the communication fluent.

It may seem a common idea nowadays, but it was the first implementation done in Spain! Was PoC in the city of Reus.
